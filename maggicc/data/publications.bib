  abstract =     {Modern vehicles, and in particular electric
                  vehicles, are increasingly being equipped with
                  interconnected computer systems, which collect
                  information through vehicular sources and remote,
                  Internet-connected services. Unfortunately, this
                  creates a non-negligible attack surface, which
                  extends even more when vehicles are integrated with
                  smartphones to offer advanced services. In fact,
                  embedded systems on vehicles have been developed to
                  address safety, not security
                  requirements. Furthermore, vehicles have real-time
                  constraints, and the typical embedded architectures
                  used on board significantly complicate security
                  designs.  In this paper, we introduce a
                  communication framework that addresses these
                  challenges and we demonstrate how a smartphone can
                  interact with a vehicle in a secure and safe
                  manner. To this end, we design a security session
                  layer that ensures end-to-end security
                  transparently. We conduct an experimental evaluation
                  on a real implementation of our security layer,
                  which shows that our solution is practical and easy
                  to use, satisfies performance constraints, and meets
                  real-time requirements by taking into account the
                  limited capabilities of our target
                  architecture. More precisely, we implement our
                  approach for an electrically-powered two-wheeler
                  manufactured by Piaggio, and show how a smartphone
                  can interact via a wireless link with the
                  battery-life controller in a secure
                  manner. Interestingly, our approach is not limited
                  to vehicles, but can be used in other application
                  domains where a smartphone needs to securely
                  interact with an embedded device.}

  Abstract =     {Our research concentrates on anomaly detection
                  techniques, which have both industrial applications
                  such as network monitoring and protection, as well
                  as research applications such as software behavioral
                  analysis or malware classification. During our
                  doctoral research, we worked on anomaly detection
                  from three different perspective, as a complex
                  computer infrastructure has several weak spots that
                  must be protected. We first focused on the operating
                  system, central to any computer, to avoid malicious
                  code to subvert its normal activity. Secondly, we
                  concentrated on web applications, which are the main
                  interface to modern computing: Because of their
                  immense popularity, they have indeed become the most
                  targeted entry point of intrusions. Last, we
                  developed novel techniques with the aim of
                  identifying related events (e.g., alerts reported by
                  intrusion detection systems) to build new and more
                  compact knowledge to detect malicious activity on
                  large-scale systems. During our research we enhanced
                  existing anomaly detection tools and also
                  contributed with new ones. Such tools have been
                  tested over different datasets, both synthetic data
                  and real network traffic, and lead to interesting
                  results that were accepted for publication at main

  Abstract =     {Malware analysts, and in particular antivirus
                  vendors, never agreed on a single naming convention
                  for malware specimens. This leads to confusion and
                  difficulty---more for researchers than for
                  practitioners---for example, when comparing coverage
                  of different antivirus engines, when integrating and
                  systematizing known threats, or comparing the
                  classifications given by different
                  detectors. Clearly, solving naming inconsistencies
                  is a very difficult task, as it requires that
                  vendors agree on a unified naming convention. More
                  importantly, solving inconsistencies is impossible
                  without knowing exactly where they are. Therefore,
                  in this paper we take a step back and concentrate on
                  the problem of finding inconsistencies. To this end,
                  we first represent each vendor's naming convention
                  with a graph-based model. Second, we give a precise
                  definition of inconsistency with respect to these
                  models. Third, we define two quantitative measures
                  to calculate the overall degree of inconsistency
                  between vendors. In addition, we propose a fast
                  algorithm that finds non-trivial (i.e., beyond
                  syntactic differences) inconsistencies. Our
                  experiments on four major antivirus vendors and
                  98,798 real-world malware samples confirm anecdotal
                  observations that different vendors name viruses
                  differently. More importantly, we were able to find
                  inconsistencies that cannot be inferred at all by
                  looking solely at the syntax.},

                  risk of exposing sensitive information on the go. In
                  this paper, we arise this concern by presenting an
                  automatic attack against mod- ern touchscreen
                  keyboards. We demonstrate the attack against the
                  Apple iPhone---2010's most popular touchscreen
                  device---although it can be adapted to other devices
                  (e.g., Android) that employ similar key-magnifying
                  keyboards. Our attack processes the stream of frames
                  from a video camera (e.g., surveillance or portable
                  camera) and recognizes keystrokes online, in a
                  fraction of the time needed to perform the same task
                  by direct observation or offline analysis of a
                  recorded video, which can be unfeasible for large
                  amount of data. Our attack detects, tracks, and
                  rectifies the target touchscreen, thus following the
                  device or camera's movements and eliminating
                  possible perspective distortions and rotations In
                  real-world settings, our attack can automatically
                  recognize up to 97.07 percent of the keystrokes
                  (91.03 on average), with 1.15 percent of errors

  Abstract =     {Touchscreen devices increase the risk of shoulder
                  surfing to such an extent that attackers could steal
                  sensitive information by simply following the victim
                  and observe his or her portable device. We underline
                  this concern by proposing an automatic shoulder
                  surfing attack against modern touchscreen keyboards
                  that display magnified keys in predictable
                  positions. We demonstrate this attack against the
                  Apple iPhone---although it can work with other
                  layouts and different devices---and show that it
                  recognizes up to 97.07\% (91.03\% on average) of the
                  keystrokes, with only 1.15\% of errors, at 37 to 51
                  keystrokes per minute: About eight times faster than
                  a human analyzing a recorded video. Our attack
                  accurately recovers the sequence of keystrokes input
                  by the user. A previous attack, which targeted
                  desktop scenarios and thus worked with very
                  restrictive settings, is similar in spirit to
                  ours. However, as it assumes that camera and target
                  keyboard are both in fixed, perpendicular position,
                  it cannot suite mobile settings, characterized by
                  moving target and skewed, rotated viewpoints. Our
                  attack, instead, requires no particular settings and
                  even allows for natural movements of both target
                  device and shoulder surfer's camera. In addition,
                  our attack yields accurate output without any
                  grammar or syntax checks, so that it can detect
                  large context-free text or non-dictionary words.},

  Abstract =     {Spying on a person is a subtle, yet easy and
                  reliable method to obtain sensitive
                  information. Even if the victim is well protected
                  from digital attacks, spying may be a viable
                  option. In addition, the pervasiveness of mobile
                  devices increases an attacker's opportunities to
                  observe the victims while they are accessing or
                  entering sensitive information. This risk is
                  exacerbated by the remarkable user-friendliness of
                  modern, mobile graphical interfaces, which, for
                  example, display visual feedback to improve the user
                  experience and make common tasks, \eg, typing, more
                  natural. Unfortunately, this turns into the
                  well-known trade-off between usability and security.
                  In this work, we focus on how usability of modern
                  mobile interfaces may affect the users' privacy. In
                  particular, we describe a practical eavesdropping
                  attack, able to recognize the sequence of keystrokes
                  from a low-resolution video, recorded while the
                  victim is typing on a touchscreen. Our attack
                  exploits the fact that modern virtual keyboards, as
                  opposed to mechanical ones, often display magnified,
                  virtual keys in predictable positions. To
                  demonstrate the feasibility of this attack we
                  implemented it against 2010's most popular
                  smart-phone, \ie, the \smiPhone. Our approach works
                  under realistic conditions, because it tracks and
                  rectifies the target screen according to the
                  victim's natural movements, before performing the
                  keystroke recognition. On real-world settings, our
                  attack can automatically recognize up to 97.07\%
                  (91.03\% on average) of the keystrokes, with a
                  1.15\% error rate and a speed between 37 and 51
                  keystrokes per minute. This work confirms that
                  touchscreen keyboards that magnify keys make
                  automatic eavesdropping attacks easier than in
                  classic mobile keyboards.},

  Abstract =     {Manual analysis of security-related events is still
                  a necessity to investigate non-trivial cyber
                  attacks. This task is particularly hard when the
                  events involve slow, stealthy and large-scale
                  activities typical of the modern cybercriminals'
                  strategy. In this regard, visualization tools can
                  effectively help analysts in their
                  investigations. In this paper, we present BURN, an
                  interactive visualization tool for displaying
                  autonomous systems exhibiting rogue activity that
                  helps at finding misbehaving networks through visual
                  and interactive exploration. Up to seven values are
                  displayed in a single visual element, while avoiding
                  cumbersome and confusing maps. To this end,
                  animations and alpha channels are leveraged to
                  create simple views that highlight relevant activity
                  patterns. In addition, BURN incorporates a simple
                  algorithm to identify migrations of nefarious
                  services across autonomous systems, which can
                  support, for instance, root-cause analysis and law
                  enforcement investigations.},

  Abstract =     {The world of information and communication
                  technology is experiencing changes that, regardless
                  of some skepticism, are bringing to life the concept
                  of ``utility computing''. The nostalgics observed a
                  parallel between the emerging paradigm of cloud
                  computing and the traditional time-sharing era,
                  depicting clouds as the modern reincarnation of
                  mainframes available on a pay-per-use basis, and
                  equipped with virtual, elastic, disks-as-a-service
                  that replace the old physical disks with
                  quotas. This comparison is fascinating, but more
                  importantly, in our opinion, it prepares the ground
                  for constructive critiques regarding the security of
                  such a computing paradigm and, especially, one of
                  its key components: web services. In this paper we
                  discuss our position about the current
                  countermeasures (e.g., intrusion detection systems,
                  anti-malware), developed to mitigate well-known web
                  security threats. By reasoning on said affinities,
                  we focus on the simple case study of anomaly-based
                  approaches, which are employed in many modern
                  protection tools, not just in intrusion
                  detectors. We illustrate our position by the means
                  of a simple running example and show that attacks
                  against injection vulnerabilities, a widespread
                  menace that is easily recognizable with ordinary
                  anomaly-based checks, can be difficult to detect if
                  web services are protected as they were regular web
                  applications. Along this line, we concentrate on a
                  few, critical hypotheses that demand particular
                  attention. Although in this emerging landscape only
                  a minority of threats qualify as novel, they could
                  be difficult to recognize with the current
                  countermeasures and thus can expose web services to
                  new attacks. We conclude by proposing simple
                  modifications to the current countermeasures to cope
                  with the aforesaid security issues.},

  Abstract =     {Phishers nowadays rely on a variety of channels,
                  ranging from old-fashioned emails to instant
                  messages, social networks, and the phone system
                  (with both calls and text messages), with the goal
                  of reaching more victims. As a consequence, modern
                  phishing became a multi-faceted, even more pervasive
                  threat that is inherently more difficult to study
                  than traditional, email-based phishing. This short
                  paper describes the status of a data collection
                  system we are developing to capture different
                  aspects of phishing campaigns, with a particular
                  focus on the emerging use of the voice channel. The
                  general approach is to record inbound calls received
                  on decoy phone lines, place outbound calls to the
                  same caller identifiers (when available) and also to
                  telephone numbers obtained from different
                  sources. Specifically, our system analyzes instant
                  messages (e.g., automated social engineering
                  attempts) and suspicious emails (e.g., spam,
                  phishing), and extracts telephone numbers, URLs and
                  popular words from the content. In addition, users
                  can voluntarily submit voice phishing (vishing)
                  attempts through a public website. Extracted
                  telephone numbers, URLs and popular words will be
                  correlated to recognize campaigns by means of
                  cross-channel relationships between messages.},

  Abstract =     {Phishing is the practice of eliciting a person's
                  confidential information such as name, date of birth
                  or credit card details. Typically, the phishers use
                  simple technologies (e.g., e-mailing) to spread
                  social engineering attacks with the goal of
                  persuading a large amount of victims into
                  voluntarily disclose sensitive data. Phishing based
                  on e-mail and web technologies is certainly the most
                  popular form. It has indeed received ample attention
                  and some mitigation measures have been implemented.
                  In this paper we describe our study on vishing
                  (voice phishing), a form of phishing where the
                  scammers exploit the phone channel to ask for
                  sensitive information, rather than sending e-mails
                  and cloning trustworthy websites. In some sense, the
                  traditional ala-Mitnick phone scams are streamlined
                  by attackers using techniques that are typical of
                  modern, e-mail-based phishing. We detail our
                  analysis of an embryonic, real-world database of
                  vishing attacks reported by victims through a
                  publicly-available web application that we build for
                  this purpose. The vishing activity that we
                  registered in our preliminary analysis is targeted
                  against the U.S. customers. According to our
                  samples, we analyzed to what extent the criminals
                  rely on automated responders to streamline the
                  vishing campaigns. In addition, we analyzed the
                  content of the conversations and found that words
                  such as ``credit'', ``press'' (a key) or ``account''
                  are fairly popular. In addition, we describe the
                  data collection infrastructure and motivate why
                  gathering data about vishing is more difficult than
                  for regular e-mail phishing.},

  Abstract =     {Anomaly-based techniques were exploited successfully
                  to implement protection mechanisms for various
                  systems. Recently, these approaches have been ported
                  to the web domain under the name of ``web
                  application anomaly detectors'' (or firewalls) with
                  promising results. In particular, those capable of
                  automatically building specifications, or models, of
                  the protected application by observing its traffic
                  (e.g., network packets, system calls, or HTTP
                  requests and responses) are particularly
                  interesting, since they can be deployed with little
                  effort. Typically, the detection accuracy of these
                  systems is significantly influenced by the model
                  building phase (often called training), which
                  clearly depends upon the quality of the observed
                  traffic, which should resemble the normal activity
                  of the protected application and must be also free
                  from attacks. Otherwise, detection may result in
                  significant amounts of false positives (i.e., benign
                  events flagged as anomalous) and negatives (i.e.,
                  undetected threats). In this work we describe
                  Masibty, a web application anomaly detector that
                  have some interesting properties. First, it requires
                  the training data not to be attack-free. Secondly,
                  not only it protects the monitored application, it
                  also detects and blocks malicious client-side
                  threats before they are sent to the browser. Third,
                  Masibty intercepts the queries before they are sent
                  to the database, correlates them with the
                  corresponding HTTP requests and blocks those deemed
                  anomalous. Both the accuracy and the performance
                  have been evaluated on real-world web applications
                  with interesting results. The system is almost not
                  influenced by the presence of attacks in the
                  training data and shows only a negligible amount of
                  false positives, although this is paid in terms of a
                  slight performance overhead.},

  Abstract =     {Learning-based anomaly detection has proven to be an
                  effective black-box technique for detecting unknown
                  attacks.  However, the effectiveness of this
                  technique crucially depends upon both the quality
                  and the completeness of the training data.
                  Unfortunately, in most cases, the traffic to the
                  system (e.g., a web application or daemon process)
                  protected by an anomaly detector is not uniformly
                  distributed. Therefore, some components (e.g.,
                  authentication, payments, or content publishing)
                  might not be exercised enough to train an anomaly
                  detection system in a reasonable time frame.  This
                  is of particular importance in real-world settings,
                  where anomaly detection systems are deployed with
                  little or no manual configuration, and they are
                  expected to automatically learn the normal behavior
                  of a system to detect or block attacks. In this
                  work, we first demonstrate that the features
                  utilized to train a learning-based detector can be
                  semantically grouped, and that features of the same
                  group tend to induce similar models.  Therefore, we
                  propose addressing local training data deficiencies
                  by exploiting clustering techniques to construct a
                  knowledge base of well-trained models that can be
                  utilized in case of undertraining.  Our approach,
                  which is independent of the particular type of
                  anomaly detector employed, is validated using the
                  realistic case of a learning-based system protecting
                  a pool of web servers running several web
                  applications such as blogs, forums, or Web
                  services. We run our experiments on a real-world

  Abstract =     {Because of the ad hoc nature of web applications,
                  intrusion detection systems that leverage machine
                  learning techniques are particularly well-suited for
                  protecting websites. The reason is that these
                  systems are able to characterize the applications'
                  normal behavior in an automated fashion. However,
                  anomaly-based detectors for web applications suffer
                  from false positives that are generated whenever the
                  applications being protected change. These false
                  positives need to be analyzed by the security
                  officer who then has to interact with the web
                  application developers to confirm that the reported
                  alerts were indeed erroneous detections. In this
                  paper, we propose a novel technique for the
                  automatic detection of changes in web applications,
                  which allows for the selective retraining of the
                  affected anomaly detection models. We demonstrate
                  that, by correctly identifying legitimate changes in
                  web applications, we can reduce false positives and
                  allow for the automated retraining of the anomaly
                  models. We have evaluated our approach by analyzing
                  a number of real-world applications. Our analysis
                  shows that web applications indeed change
                  substantially over time, and that our technique is
                  able to effectively detect changes and automatically
                  adapt the anomaly detection models to the new
                  structure of the changed web applications.},

  Abstract =     {We describe an unsupervised host-based intrusion
                  detection system based on system calls arguments and
                  sequences. We define a set of anomaly detection
                  models for the individual parameters of the call. We
                  then describe a clustering process which helps to
                  better fit models to system call arguments, and
                  creates inter-relations among different arguments of
                  a system call. Finally, we add a behavioral Markov
                  model in order to capture time correlations and
                  abnormal behaviors. The whole system needs no prior
                  knowledge input; it has a good signal to noise

                  technology is experiencing changes that, regardless
                  of some skepticism, are bringing to life the concept
                  of ``utility computing''. The nostalgics observed a
                  parallel between the emerging paradigm of cloud
                  computing and the traditional time-sharing era,
                  depicting clouds as the modern reincarnation of
                  mainframes available on a pay-per-use basis, and
                  equipped with virtual, elastic, paid
                  disks-as-a-service that replace the old physical
                  disks with quotas. This comparison is fascinating,
                  but more importantly, in our opinion, it prepares
                  the ground for constructive critiques regarding the
                  security of such computing paradigm. In this paper
                  we explore similar analogies to discuss our position
                  about the current countermeasures (e.g., intrusion
                  detection systems, anti-viruses), developed to
                  mitigate well-known security threats. By reasoning
                  on said affinities, we focus on the simple case of
                  anomaly-based approaches, which are employed in many
                  modern protection tools, not just in intrusion
                  detectors. We illustrate our position by the means
                  of a simple running example and show that attacks
                  against injection vulnerabilities, a current menace
                  that is easily recognizable with ordinary
                  anomaly-based checks, can be difficult to detect if
                  web services are assumed to be regular web
                  applications. Along this line, we concentrate on a
                  few, critical hypotheses that demand particular
                  attention. We conclude that, although only a
                  minority of threats qualify as novel, they are well
                  camouflaged and can be difficult to recognize behind
                  the confusion caused by the cloud computing
